# WHY
- Problem
    - I have tried a number of digital & analog strategies to manage my daily / weekly / monthly activities. Most of them are very good at their level of granularity but few offer functionality to show both high level long term objective / goal tracking alongside detailed current projects / task information.

- Project Goals:
    - Demonstrate my capabilities as a full stack developer
    - Create a central location to manage:
        1) Goals / Objectives -> 'fluffy' 
        2) Projects / Tasks -> 'tangible'
    - Export Weekly Report To User
    - Try, Tweak, Test, & Learn good processes for:
        1) Planning & Communicating Development Plan
        2) Documentation
        3) Version Control

# Development Progress

## Phase 1
- Mindset -> Initial Idea was 'hackathon' like -> how far could get I get as fast as possible (with good practices and functionality of course lol). This was then interupted by an actual hackathon which caused me to step away from the project and upon retuning, rethink and retool everything for Phase 2.
- Ideation
- Component Boilerplate
- Versions Included: V0 - V2.2

## Phase 2
- Mindset -> Production ready at all times
- Limited scope
- Grow DB / Code base with development vs full planning / scaffolding @ start
- Versions Included: V3+
